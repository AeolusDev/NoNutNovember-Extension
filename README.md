# NoNutNovember-Extension

An extension created to help you win NoNutNovember. This extension will block your access to multiple pornographic sites including but not limited to NSFW Cam sites, Hentai sites, Doujinshi sites, etc.

## What does it do?
-> Currently the extension only closes the tabs you open if a match of their hostname is found on my database preventing you from accessing all their pages.

## Future Plans
  ### 1. A Tracker
  To help you keep track of your progress. It will auto-update itself if it detects that you haven't opened a horny site during the NNN challenge. You'll also be able to           update it manually. 

  ### 2. Add Custom Sites
  The ability to add your own sites. Currently, the database only contains famous sites or sites that are listed on Website Indexes such as:
  <br>
    ~ [FMHY](https://fmhy.pages.dev/nsfwpiracy/)
    <br>
    ~ [EverythingMoe](https://everythingmoe.com/)
    <br>
    ~ [The Index](https://theindex.moe/)
    <br>
    <br>
    Currently, the only way to add your own sites is by sending a request to the [Issues Page](https://github.com/AeolusDev/NoNutNovember-Extension/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
